# Dengue Fever Outbreaks

Data provided by DrivenData: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

Dengue (pronounced DENgee) fever is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses. An estimated 400 million dengue infections occur worldwide each year, with about 96 million resulting in illness. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. It canâ€™t be spread directly from one person to another person.

The data was cleaned in excel and new feature variables such as "day of week" were extracted. I approached the problem as a regression problem. I used scikit-learn's regressors in the "DengAi Sklearn Models" jupyter notebook. I also tried a neural network solution with Keras in the "DengAi Neural Networks" jupyter notebook. My final submissions placed me in the top 71st percentile of entries.

In hindsight I could have also tried multivariate time series analysis.
