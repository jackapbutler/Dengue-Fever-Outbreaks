Dengue (pronounced DENgee) fever is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses. An estimated 400 million dengue infections occur worldwide each year, with about 96 million resulting in illness. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. It canâ€™t be spread directly from one person to another person.
